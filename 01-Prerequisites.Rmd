# Prerequisites

As any course there is some knowledge that is needed to understand the concepts
and ideas that we are going to see in class. These knowledge can be categorized
into 4 different topics:

* [General Math](#general-math)
* [Linear Algebra](#linear-algebra)
* [Probability](#probability)
* [Statistics](#statistics)
* [Calculus](#calculus)

## General Math

You have to be familiar with the **summation operator** $\sum$.

The summation operator is defined as follows:

$$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n $$
Some important properties of the operator are:

* Linearity:
$$\sum_{i=1}^N(a + bx_i) = a + b \sum_{i=1}^N x_i$$
* Additivity:
$$\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i + y_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i + \sum_{i=1}^n y_i$$

## Linear Algebra

In terms of linear algebra you have to be familiar with the following concepts:

* Matrices
* Determinants
* Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
* Diagonalization
* Vector Spaces
* Linear transformations

## Probability

* Expected Value.
* Variance.
* Covariance.
* Correlation.
* Joint, marginal and conditional distributions.
* Independence.
* Central Limit Theorem.
* Distributions:
  + Normal
  + Chi Squared ($\chi^2$) distribution.
  + t distribution
  + F distribution
  
## Statistics

* Point Estimation
  + Maximum likelihood
  + Least squares estimation
* Properties of Point estimators:
  + Unbiased
  + Consistent
  + Minimum Variance
