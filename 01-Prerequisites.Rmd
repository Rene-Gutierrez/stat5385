# Prerequisites

Before diving into the course, itâ€™s important to have a solid understanding of the following foundational concepts. These are categorized into five key topics:

* [General Math](#general-math)
* [Linear Algebra](#linear-algebra)
* [Probability](#probability)
* [Statistics](#statistics)
* [Calculus](#calculus)

## General Math

You should be familiar with the **summation operator** $\sum$. This operator is defined as follows:

$$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n $$

Key properties of the summation operator include:

* **Linearity**:
  $$\sum_{i=1}^N (a + b x_i) = aN + b \sum_{i=1}^N x_i$$

* **Additivity**:
  $$\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i + y_i) = \sum_{i=1}^N x_i + \sum_{i=1}^N y_i$$

## Linear Algebra

You should be familiar with the following linear algebra concepts:

* Matrices
* Determinants
* Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
* Diagonalization
* Vector Spaces
* Linear Transformations

## Probability

Key probability concepts to understand include:

* Expected Value
* Variance
* Covariance
* Correlation
* Joint, Marginal, and Conditional Distributions
* Independence
* Central Limit Theorem
* Distributions:
  * Normal
  * Chi-Squared ($\chi^2$)
  * t-distribution
  * F-distribution

## Statistics

Essential statistical concepts include:

* **Point Estimation**:
  * Maximum Likelihood
  * Least Squares Estimation

* **Properties of Point Estimators**:
  * Unbiased
  * Consistent
  * Minimum Variance

* **Interval Estimation**
