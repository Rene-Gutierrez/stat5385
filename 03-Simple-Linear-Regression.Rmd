# Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression (**SLR**) is a linear regression model with a single explanatory variable. It focuses on the linear relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable, making it the most basic form of linear regression analysis.

## Model

The model for simple linear regression is as follows:

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + e_i, \quad i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$$

where:

* $y_i$ represents the $i$-th observation of the dependent variable.
* $x_i$ represents the $i$-th observation of the independent variable.
* $e_i$ represents the $i$-th observation of the error term.
* $\beta_0$ is the intercept of the linear model, or regression line.
* $\beta_1$ is the slope of the linear model, or regression line.
* $n$ is the number of observations for both variables.

Note that we are not making any assumptions about the error terms.

In the case of the [wine example](#wine-example), we generated the data based on the following linear model:

$$y_i = 75 + 1.5 x_i + e_i $$


```{r slr-parts}
dat <- read.csv(file = "Wine Data.csv")
plot(x    = dat$Glasses,
     y    = dat$Years,
     xlab = "Avg. Glasses of Wine per Week",
     ylab = "Life Expectancy (Years)")
abline(a   = 75,
       b   = 1.5,
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)
abline(v   = 0,
       lwd = 2)
text(x = 0.25, y = 76, expression(beta[0] ~ "=75"))
text(x = 3.25, y = 79, expression(beta[1] ~ "=1.5"))
segments(x0 = c(2, 3),
         x1 = c(3, 3),
         y0 = c(78, 78),
         y1 = c(78, 79.5),
         lwd = 2,
         col = 'blue')
```

In this case, the intercept $\beta_0$ is meaningful, as it represents the expected number of years a person would live if they didnâ€™t drink wine at all. However, depending on the data, the intercept may or may not have a meaningful interpretation. The slope $\beta_1$ indicates that for each additional glass of wine consumed per week, our model predicts an increase of 1.5 years in life expectancy.

In practice, we rarely know the true regression line. Instead, it must be estimated from the data. The goal is to find the "best" line that fits the data, where "best" means the line that minimizes the sum of squared errors (SSE) between the observed values and the values predicted by the model.

## Least Squares Estimation

As explained before, we want to minimize the SSE, we can create a function of 
$\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ with this sum as follows:

$$Q(\beta_0, \beta_1) = \sum_{i=1}^n (e_i(\beta_0, \beta_1))^2 
= \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)^2  $$

and we can find the minimum of this function easily since it is a differentiable function. We can find the both components of the gradient and equal them to zero to find the critical points. We start with $\beta_0$:

\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \beta_0} 
  &= \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta_0} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)^2 \\
  &= \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta_0} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i^2 + \beta_0^2 + \beta_1^2 x_i^2 - 2 \beta_0 y_i - 2 \beta_1 x_i y_i + 2 \beta_0 \beta_1 x_i) \\
  &= \sum_{i = 1}^n (2 \beta_0 - 2 y_i + 2 \beta_1 x_i) \\
  &= -2 \left( n \beta_0 - n \bar{y} + n\beta_1 \bar{x} \right)
\end{align*}

where we have adopted the notation: $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^n x_i$ and $\bar{y} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^n y_i$.

\begin{align}
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \beta_0} = 0 
  &\iff -2 \left( n \beta_0 - n \bar{y} + n\beta_1 \bar{x} \right) = 0 \notag \\
  &\iff \beta_0 = \bar{y} - \beta_1 \bar{x} \tag{1}
\end{align}

And we can do a similar thing for $\beta_1$:

\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \beta_1} 
  &= \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta_0} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)^2 \\
  &= \sum_{i = 1}^n 2(y_i -\beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)(-x_i) \\
  &= -2\sum_{i = 1}^n y_i x_i + 2 \beta_0 \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i + 2 \beta_1 \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2 \\
  &= -2\sum_{i = 1}^n y_i x_i + 2 n \beta_0 \bar{x} + 2 \beta_1 \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2
\end{align*}

then:

\begin{align}
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \beta_1} = 0 
  &\iff -2\sum_{i = 1}^n y_i x_i + 2 n \beta_0 \bar{x} + 2 \beta_1 \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2 = 0 \notag \\
  &\iff \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i x_i = n \beta_0 \bar{x} + \beta_1  \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2 \tag{2}
\end{align}

Now, substituting (1) into (2) we have that

\begin{align*}
\sum_{i = 1}^n y_i x_i 
  &= n (\bar{y} - \beta_1 \bar{x}) \bar{x}  + \beta_1  \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2 \\
  &= n \bar{y} \bar{x} - n \beta_1 \bar{x}^2 + \beta_1  \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2 \\
  &= n \bar{y} \bar{x} + \beta_1 \left( \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2 - n \bar{x}^2 \right)
\end{align*}

Then, 

$$ \beta_1 = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n y_i x_i - n \bar{y} \bar{x}}{\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2 - n \bar{x}^2} $$

so, the only critical point for $Q(\beta_0,\beta_1)$ is when:

$$ \hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n y_i x_i - n \bar{y} \bar{x}}{\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2 - n \bar{x}^2} $$
$$ \hat{\beta_0} = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}$$

where we use $\hat{}$, to denote the specific critical point. It remains to see
if this is indeed a minimum. One can check the second order conditions.

Now, if we introduce the notation for sample variance and covariance:

$$ S^2_{xx} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2 $$
$$ S_{xy}   = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y}) $$

and note the following:

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2
  &= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i^2 - 2\bar{x}x_i + \bar{x}^2) \\
  &= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - 2\bar{x}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i + \sum_{i=1}^n \bar{x}^2 \\
  &= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - 2\bar{x}(n\bar{x}) + n \bar{x}^2 \\
  &= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - 2n\bar{x}^2 + n \bar{x}^2 \\
  &= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - n\bar{x}^2
\end{align*}

and

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})
  &= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_iy_i - \bar{x}y_i - \bar{y}x_i + \bar{x}\bar{y}) \\
  &= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n x_iy_i - \bar{x} \sum_{i=1}^ny_i - \bar{y} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i + \sum_{i=1}^n \bar{x}\bar{y} \\
  &= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n x_iy_i - n\bar{x} \bar{y} - n\bar{y} \bar{x} + n \bar{x}\bar{y} \\
  &= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n x_iy_i - n\bar{x} \bar{y} \\
\end{align*}

then we can express $\hat{\beta}_1$ as:

$$\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{(n-1)S_{xy}}{(n-1)S_{xx}^2}=\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}^2} $$

Now notice that in order to find the Least Squares estimates you don't require
the complete data set, but only require the following quantities:

* $\bar{y}$.
* $\bar{x}$.
* $S_{xx}^2$.
* $S_{xy}$.

### Other estimated quantites

If we use the Least squares estimates in the regression equation, we can derive
other estimated quantities:

The estimated value for observation $i$:

$$ \hat{y}_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_i $$

and the estimated error:

$$ \hat{e}_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i = y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_i $$

And we can also compare our estimated regression line (blue) with the real 
regression line (red) in the following as follows:

```{r slr-real-vs-est}
outReg <- lm(Years ~ Glasses, data = dat)
plot(x    = dat$Glasses,
     y    = dat$Years,
     xlab = "Avg. Glasses of Wine per Week",
     ylab = "Life Expectancy (Years)")
abline(a   = 75,
       b   = 1.5,
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)
abline(a   = outReg$coefficients[1],
       b   = outReg$coefficients[2],
       col = 'blue',
       lwd = 2)
```

## Properties of the Estimates

The estimates $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$ are linear combinations of 
$\mathbf{y} = (y_1,\ldots,y_n)'$. To see this, notice the following:

\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y}) \\
  &= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i - n \bar{x} \bar{y} \\
  &= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i - \bar{x} \sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\
  &= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i - \sum_{i=1}^n \bar{x} y_i \\
  &= \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i y_i - \bar{x} y_i) \\
  &= \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) y_i \\
\end{align*}

Then

$$ \hat{\beta}_1 =  \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n y_i x_i - n \bar{y} \bar{x}}{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2} = \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{(x_i - \bar{x}) }{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}y_i $$

and similarly:

$$ \hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{y_i}{n} - \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{(x_i - \bar{x}) }{\sum_{j = 1}^n x_j^2 - n \bar{x}^2}y_i \bar{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{(x_i - \bar{x}) }{\sum_{j = 1}^n x_j^2 - n \bar{x}^2} \bar{x} \right)y_i $$

Also, notice that the sum of the errors is $0$.

\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{e}_i 
  &= \sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_i) \\
  &= \sum_{i=1}^n y_i - \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\
  &= n\bar{y} - n \hat{\beta}_0 - n \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x} \\
  &= n\bar{y} - n (\bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}) - n \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x} \\
  &= n\bar{y} - n \bar{y} + n \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x} - n \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x} \\
  &= 0
\end{align*}

If we let $\hat{\mathbf{e}} = (\hat{e}_i,\ldots,\hat{e}_n)'$ and $\mathbf{x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)'$,
two vectors of size $n$, then we have that $\hat{\mathbf{e}}$ and $\mathbf{x}$ are orthogonal.
That is:


\begin{align*}
\langle \hbe, \bx \rangle 
  &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \he_i x_i \\
  &= \sum_{i=1}^{n}  (y_i - \hgb_0 - \hgb_1 x_i)x_i \\
  &= \sum_{i=1}^{n}  (y_i x_i - \hgb_0x_i - \hgb_1 x_i x_i) \\
  &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i x_i - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \hgb_0x_i - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \hgb_1 x_i x_i \\
  &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - n \hgb_0 \bar{x} - \hgb_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 \\
  &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - n (\bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}) \bar{x} - \hgb_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 \\
  &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - n \bar{y} \bar{x} + n\hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}^2 - \hgb_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 \\
  &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - n \bar{y} \bar{x} - \hat{\beta}_1 (\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - n\bar{x}^2)  \\
  &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - n \bar{y} \bar{x} -  \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n y_i x_i - n \bar{y} \bar{x}}{\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2 - n \bar{x}^2}(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - n\bar{x}^2)  \\
  &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - n \bar{y} \bar{x} -  (\sum_{i = 1}^n y_i x_i - n \bar{y} \bar{x})  \\
  &=0
\end{align*}

The same applies to $\hby = (\hy_1,\ldots,\hby_n)'$ and $\hbe$, as we can see:

\begin{align*}
\langle \hbe, \hby \rangle 
  &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \he_i \hy_i \\
  &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \he_i(\hgb_0 + \hgb_1 x_i) \\
  &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\he_i \hgb_0 + he_i \hgb_1 x_i) \\
  &= \hgb_0 \sum_{i=1}^{n} \he_i + \hgb_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} he_i x_i \\
  &= \hgb_1 \langle \hbe, \bx \rangle  \\
  &= 0
\end{align*}

Finally, the average of $\hby$ and $\by$ are the same, to see this notice:

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \hy_i 
  &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\hgb_0 + \hgb_1 x_i) \\
  &= \frac{1}{n} (n \hgb_0 + \hgb_1 \sum_{i=1}^n x_i) \\
  &= \frac{1}{n} (n \hgb_0 + n \hgb_1 \bx) \\
  &= \hgb_0 + \hgb_1 \bx \\
  &= \bar{y} - \hgb_1 \bx  + \hgb_1 \bx \\
  &= \bar{y} \\
\end{align*}

## Centering and Standarizing the Data

Some transformations of the data can help the regression analysis 
or make it more intuitive. There are 2 main transformations of the data: 
**centering** and **standardization**.

Consider observations $x_1,\ldots,x_n$, then the centered version of observation
$i$ is given by:

$$x_i' = x_i - \bar{x}$$

The new observations $x_1',\ldots,x_n'$ are centered and their mean is $0$.

$$\bar{x}' = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i' = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) = \frac{1}{n} \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - \sum_{i=1}^n \bar{x} \right) = \frac{1}{n} \left(n\bar{x} - n \bar{x} \right) = 0$$
Also, let us see that the variance of the standardized variables is the same as 
the variance of the original observations.

$$ S_{xx}' = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i' - \bar{x}') = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i') = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) = S_{xx} $$
So the variance of the observations is not affected by the centering.

If we center another set of observations $y_1,\ldots,y_n$, and compute the covariance,
we have that it also doesn't change.

$$S_{xy}' = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i' - \bar{x})(y_i' - \bar{x}) = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i')(y_i') = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{x}) = S_{xy}$$

The standardized version of observation $i$ is given by:

$$x_i'' = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{\sqrt{S_{xx}}} = \frac{x_i'}{\sqrt{S_{xx}}}$$



The standardized observations have mean of 0 and variance 1. Let's see first that
the sample mean is 

$$ \bar{x}_i'' =  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i'' =  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i'}{\sqrt{S_{xx}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{S_{xx}}}\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i' = \frac{1}{\sqrt{S_{xx}}} \bar{x}' = 0$$

Now let us see that the variance of the standardized  observations is 1.

\begin{align*}
S_{xx}'' 
  &= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i'' - \bar{x}'')^2 \\
  &= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i'')^2 \\
  &= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{\sqrt{S_{xx}}}\right)^2 \\
  &= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{S_{xx}} \\
  &= \frac{1}{S_{xx}} \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \\
  &= \frac{1}{S_{xx}}S_{xx} \\
  &= 1
\end{align*}

Now, let us introduce the sample correlation as:

$$ r_{xy} = \frac{S_{xy}}{\sqrt{S_{xx}{S_{yy}}}} $$
If we standardize two sets of observations, then the covaraince of the standardized version
is the correlation of the standardized version. Let us see it:

\begin{align*}
S_{xy}'' 
  &= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1} (x_i'' - \bar{x}'')(y_i'' - \bar{x}'') \\
  &= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1} (x_i'')(y_i'') \\
  &= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1} \left(\frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{\sqrt{S_{xx}}}\right) \left(\frac{y_i - \bar{y}}{\sqrt{S_{yy}}}\right) \\
  &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{S_{yy}}\sqrt{S_{xx}}}\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1} (x_i - \bar{x}) (y_i - \bar{y}) \\
  &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{S_{yy}}\sqrt{S_{xx}}} S_{xy} \\
  &= r_{xy}
\end{align*}

With this results, we can analyze the effects of following 3 scenarios on the
estimated coefficients:

* Independent variable centered.
* Both, Independent and dependent variable centered.
* Both, Independent and dependent variable standardized.

### Independent variable centered

Lets compute the value for $\beta_1$ when the data is centered.

$$\hgb_1' = \frac{S_{xy}'}{S_{xx}'} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \hgb_1 $$
So centering the data doesn't change the value of the estimated slope.

$$ \hgb_0' = \bar{y} - \hgb_1' \bar{x}' = \bar{y} - \hgb_1' 0 = \bar{y} $$
So centering the data, makes the estimated intercept to coincide with the mean of
the independent variable.

We can see this in one of our example data sets, looking at the ad spending data
we can perform linear regression on the original data and the centered data:

```{r center-x}
# Read Data
dat <- read.csv("Ad spending Data.csv")
# Assign data
x <- dat$Ad.Spending
y <- dat$Revenue
# Centers x
xCen <- x - mean(x)
# Linear regression on the original data
outRegOri <- lm(y ~ x)
# Linear regression on the centered independent variable data
outRegCen <- lm(y ~ xCen)
# Plots
## Two plots in the same image
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
## Original data
# Plots the points
plot(x    = x,
     y    = y,
     xlab = "Ad spending",
     ylab = "Revenue")
# Plots the regression line
abline(a   = outRegOri$coefficients[1],
       b   = outRegOri$coefficients[2],
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)
## Independent Variable centered data
# Plots the points
plot(x    = xCen,
     y    = y,
     xlab = "Ad spending (Centered)",
     ylab = "Revenue")
# Plots the regression line
abline(a   = outRegCen$coefficients[1],
       b   = outRegCen$coefficients[2],
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)
abline(v   = 0,
       lwd = 2)
```

So we can appreciate that centering the independent variable just shifts the data
horizontally so the mean will be at zero.

### Both Variables centered

Now lets see the effects when both variables are centered. Here, we will denote
the estimates again with one prime, that is $\hgb'$.

Again, the estimate of the slope doesn't change:

$$\hgb_1' = \frac{S_{xy}'}{S_{xx}'} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \hgb_1 $$
while the estimate of the intercept becomes zero (the new mean of the centered
dependent variable)

$$ \hgb_0' = \bar{y}' - \hgb_1' \bar{x}' = \bar{y}' = 0 $$
The effect of this transformation can be observed, here:

```{r center-xy}
# Read Data
dat <- read.csv("Ad spending Data.csv")
# Assign data
x <- dat$Ad.Spending
y <- dat$Revenue
# Centers x and y
xCen <- x - mean(x)
yCen <- y - mean(y)
# Linear regression on the original data
outRegOri <- lm(y ~ x)
# Linear regression on the centered data
outRegCen <- lm(yCen ~ xCen)
# Plots
## Two plots in the same image
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
## Original data
# Plots the points
plot(x    = x,
     y    = y,
     xlab = "Ad spending",
     ylab = "Revenue")
# Plots the regression line
abline(a   = outRegOri$coefficients[1],
       b   = outRegOri$coefficients[2],
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)
## Centered data
# Plots the points
plot(x    = xCen,
     y    = yCen,
     xlab = "Ad spending (Centered)",
     ylab = "Revenue")
# Plots the regression line
abline(a   = outRegCen$coefficients[1],
       b   = outRegCen$coefficients[2],
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)
abline(v   = 0,
       lwd = 2)
abline(h   = 0,
       lwd = 2)
```

### Independent and dependent variable standardized

Again we start we the slope estimate:

$$\hgb_1'' = \frac{S_{xy}''}{S_{xx}''} = \frac{r_{xy}}{1} =r_{xy} $$
so, the estimate of the slope is the sample correlation of the original observations.

Again, we can see this graphically:

```{r slr-standarize-xy}
# Read Data
dat <- read.csv("Ad spending Data.csv")
# Assign data
x <- dat$Ad.Spending
y <- dat$Revenue
# Standardizes x and y
xSta <- (x - mean(x))/sqrt(var(x))
ySta <- (y - mean(y))/sqrt(var(y))
# Linear regression on the original data
outRegOri <- lm(y ~ x)
# Linear regression on the standard data
outRegSta <- lm(ySta ~ xSta)
# Plots
## Two plots in the same image
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
## Original data
# Plots the points
plot(x    = x,
     y    = y,
     xlab = "Ad spending",
     ylab = "Revenue")
# Plots the regression line
abline(a   = outRegOri$coefficients[1],
       b   = outRegOri$coefficients[2],
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)
## Standard data
# Plots the points
plot(x    = xSta,
     y    = ySta,
     xlab = "Ad spending (Centered)",
     ylab = "Revenue")
# Plots the regression line
abline(a   = outRegSta$coefficients[1],
       b   = outRegSta$coefficients[2],
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)
abline(v   = 0,
       lwd = 2)
abline(h   = 0,
       lwd = 2)
```

Now, let us see that the correlation is always in the interval $(-1,1)$. To see
this, notice the following:

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i'' + y_i'')^2 
  &= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \left((x_i'')^2 + 2x_i'' y_i'' + (y_i'')^2 \right) \\
  &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i'')^2}{n-1}  + 2\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i''y_i''}{n-1}  + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i'')^2}{n-1} \\
  &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i'' - \bar{x}'')^2}{n-1}  + 2\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i'' - \bar{x}'')(y_i'' - \bar{y}'')}{n-1}  + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i'' - \bar{y}'')^2}{n-1} \\
  &= S_{xx}'' + 2 S_{xy}'' + S_{yy}'' \\
  &= 1 + 2r_{xy} + 1 \\
  &= 2(1 + r_{xy})
\end{align*}

In a similar way it can be shown that:

$$\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i'' + y_i'')^2 = 2(1 - r_{xy})$$

Now since, $$\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i'' + y_i'')^2 \geq 0$$
then we have that

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i'' + y_i'')^2 \geq 0
  &\implies 2(1 + r_{xy}) \geq 0 \\
  &\implies 1 + r_{xy} \geq 0 \\
  &\implies r_{xy} \geq -1 \\
\end{align*}

Similarly, since

$$\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i'' - y_i'')^2 \geq 0$$

implies

$$r_{xy} \leq 1 $$
then, we have that:
$$ -1 \leq r_{xy} \leq 1$$
which implies that the slope of the regression analysis after standarizing both
variables is going to be in the interval $(-1, 1)$.

## Coefficient of Determination

So far, we have been concerned on findin the "best" line, that is estimating the 
coefficients that minimize the sum of squared errors. We have find some derivated
estimated values and some properties of these values. However, we hanven't analized
how good is our estimation. To see how well we are doing we will look at the 
coeficient of determination. To do so we will first introduce some quantities:

**Total Sum of Squares** 

$$SS_{tot} = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})$$

Is a measure of total variability of the dependent 
variable. You can think of it in many ways:

* As a proxy for uncertainty. The bigger the more uncertainty in the dependent
varaible.
* It is proportional to the sample varaince.
* It is what you get if when you solve the following minimization problem:

$$ \min_{a} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \beta_0)^2 $$
that is, the best you can do to minimize the sum of squares without having access
to the independent variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$.

**Residual Sum of Squares**

$$ SS_{res} = \sumin (\he_i)^2 = \sumin (y_i - \hy_i)^2$$

The residual Sum of Squares is the minimum value of our optimization problem. It
is the the amount of variability that no matter what we do we will have remaing 
even after finding the "best" line.

**Explained Sum of Squares**

$$ SS_{reg} = \sumin (\hy_i - \bar{y}) = \sumin (\hy_i - \hat{\bar{y}}) $$

The variability of the fitted value. This is the variability we can explain with
our regression model.

These 3 quantities are related by:

$$ SS_{tot} = SS_{reg} + SS_{res} $$
That is the total variability si the sum of the variability that is explained by
the regression model and the variability we can't explain with the regression model.


\begin{align*}
SS_{tot} 
  &= \sumin (y_i - \bar{y})^2 = \sumin (y_i - \hy_i + \hy_i - \bar{y})^2 \\
  &= \sumin \left((y_i - \hy_i)^2 + 2(y_i - \hy_i)(\hy_i - \bar{y}) + (\hy_i - \bar{y})^2\right) \\
  &= \sumin(y_i - \hy_i)^2 + 2 \sumin (y_i - \hy_i)(\hy_i - \bar{y}) + \sumin (\hy_i - \bar{y})^2 \\
  &= SS_{res} + 2 \sumin (y_i - \hy_i)(\hy_i - \bar{y}) + SS_{reg} \\
  &= SS_{res} + 2 \sumin \he_i(\hy_i - \bar{y}) + SS_{reg} \\
  &= SS_{res} + 2 \sumin (\he_i\hy_i - \he_i\bar{y}) + SS_{reg} \\
  &= SS_{res} + 2 \sumin \he_i\hy_i - 2 \sumin \he_i\bar{y} + SS_{reg} \\
  &= SS_{res} + 2(0) - 2  \bar{y} \sumin \he_i + SS_{reg} \\
  &= SS_{res} - 2 \bar{y} (0) + SS_{reg} \\
  &= SS_{res} + SS_{reg} \\
\end{align*}

**Coefficient of Determination**

$$ R^2 = \frac{SS_{reg}}{SS_{tot}} = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}} $$
The coefficient of determination then can be explained as the percentage of the
total varaibility that can be explained with linear regression.

As a percentage, it has to be a number between 0 and 1. To see this let us show 
that:

$$ R^2 = r_{xy}^2 $$
To see this, first let us express $SS_{reg}$ in a more convinient way:

\begin{align*}
SS_{reg} 
  &= \sumin (\hy_i - \bar{y})^2 \\
  &= \sumin (\hgb_0 + \hgb_1 x_i - \bar{y})^2 \\
  &= \sumin (\bar{y} - \hgb_1 \bar{x} + \hgb_1 x_i - \bar{y})^2 \\
  &= \sumin (\hgb_1 x_i - \hgb_1 \bar{x})^2 \\
  &= \sumin \hgb_1^2(x_i - \bar{x})^2 \\
  &= \hgb_1^2 \sumin (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \\
  &= \hgb_1^2 S_{xx} (n-1) \\
  &= \left( \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} \right)^2 S_{xx} (n-1) \\
  &= \frac{S_{xy}^2}{S_{xx}^2} S_{xx} (n-1) \\
  &= \frac{S_{xy}^2}{S_{xx}} (n-1) \\
\end{align*}

Then, we can see that:

\begin{align*}
R^2 
  &= \frac{SS_{reg}}{SS_{tot}} \\
  &= \frac{\frac{S_{xy}^2}{S_{xx}} (n-1)}{\sumin(y_i - \bar{y})^2} \\
  &= \frac{\frac{S_{xy}^2}{S_{xx}} (n-1)}{S_{yy}(n-1)} \\
  &= \frac{S_{xy}^2}{S_{xx}S_{yy}} \\
  &= \left( \frac{S_{xy}}{\sqrt{S_{xx}S_{yy}}} \right)^2 \\
  &= r_{xy}^2
\end{align*}

The bigger the $R^2$, the better is the fit of our linear model. The $R^2$ can 
be low for 2 reasons:

* The first one is if our data is not linear, then a linear 
model will explain little about the relationship (some times a linear model can
be a good approximation of a non-linear model).
* The second reason, is when the
data is noisy. This can reduce the $R^2$ even when we know the relationship 
between the variables is linear.

As an example of noisy data, recall the Ad spending data. I actually generated 
the data under a linear model, so the relationship between the variables is linear.
You can verify this be looking at the code where the data is generated in the introduction.
Next I show the effects of adding additional noise to the data, at 3 levels:

* Level1: Small Noise.
* Level2: Medium Noise.
* Level3: High noise.

```{r r2-noise}
# Read Data
dat <- read.csv("Ad spending Data.csv")
# Assign data
x <- dat$Ad.Spending
y <- dat$Revenue

# Adds Noise
yNoiLe1 <- y + rnorm(n = 100, sd =  50)
yNoiLe2 <- y + rnorm(n = 100, sd = 200)
yNoiLe3 <- y + rnorm(n = 100, sd = 500)

# Auxiliary Variables
ymax <- max(y, yNoiLe1, yNoiLe2, yNoiLe3)
ymin <- min(y, yNoiLe1, yNoiLe2, yNoiLe3)
xmax = max(x)
xmin = min(x)

# Performs Linear Regression
outRegOri    <- lm(y ~ x)
outRegNoiLe1 <- lm(yNoiLe1 ~ x)
outRegNoiLe2 <- lm(yNoiLe2 ~ x)
outRegNoiLe3 <- lm(yNoiLe3 ~ x)

# Plots
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

plot(x    = x,
     y    = y,
     xlab = "Ad spending",
     ylab = "Revenue",
     main = "Original Data",
     ylim = c(ymin, ymax),
     xlim = c(xmin, xmax))
# Plots the regression line
abline(a   = outRegOri$coefficients[1],
       b   = outRegOri$coefficients[2],
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)
plot(x    = x,
     y    = yNoiLe1,
     xlab = "Ad spending",
     ylab = "Revenue",
     main = "Small Noise Added",
     ylim = c(ymin, ymax),
     xlim = c(xmin, xmax))
# Plots the regression line
abline(a   = outRegNoiLe1$coefficients[1],
       b   = outRegNoiLe1$coefficients[2],
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)
plot(x    = x,
     y    = yNoiLe2,
     xlab = "Ad spending",
     ylab = "Revenue",
     main = "Medium Noise Added",
     ylim = c(ymin, ymax),
     xlim = c(xmin, xmax))
# Plots the regression line
abline(a   = outRegNoiLe2$coefficients[1],
       b   = outRegNoiLe2$coefficients[2],
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)
plot(x    = x,
     y    = yNoiLe3,
     xlab = "Ad spending",
     ylab = "Revenue",
     main = "High Noise Added",
     ylim = c(ymin, ymax),
     xlim = c(xmin, xmax))
# Plots the regression line
abline(a   = outRegNoiLe3$coefficients[1],
       b   = outRegNoiLe3$coefficients[2],
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)

print("Original Data LM summary")
summary(outRegOri)
print("Level 1 LM summary")
summary(outRegNoiLe1)
print("Level 2 LM summary")
summary(outRegNoiLe2)
print("Level 3 LM summary")
summary(outRegNoiLe3)
```

where we observe that the point cloud is more dispersed and looks less than a line
the more noise is added, but the estimated regression line changes only a little bit.
We can also see how the $R^2$ becomes smaller as more noise is added.

## Residual Analysis

While the coefficient of determination can tell us how good is the fit of the
data, it can't tell us why is it good or bad. The easiest way to check for any
problems is to check the residuals or estimated errors. Right now, we will focus
on 4 problems:

* The regression function is not linear.
* The variance of the error terms is not constant.
* There are outliers.
* Important variables are ommited.

### Non-linear regression function

Sometimes the relationship between the two variables that we are analyzing is 
not linear. Looking at the example of the relationship between burger price and
burgers sold we can look at the fitted regression line and the residuals plot.

```{r burgers-residuals, echo=FALSE}
dat <- read.csv("Burger Data.csv")

outReg <- lm(Burgers ~ Price, data = dat)

# Original Data
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(x    = dat$Price,
     y    = dat$Burgers,
     xlab = "Price ($)",
     ylab = "Burgers Sold",
     main = "Original Data")
abline(a   = outReg$coefficients[1],
       b   = outReg$coefficients[2],
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)
# Residuals
plot(x = dat$Price,
     y = outReg$residuals,
     xlab = "Price ($)",
     ylab = "Residuals",
     main = "Residuals")
abline(h   = 0,
       lwd = 2)
```
Here we can clearly appreciate that there is something wrong. The residuals clearly
indicate that a non linear relationship is present in the data. One can solve these
problem by transforming one or both of the variables and then applying linear
regression. Common transformations functions $g$ are (but are not limited to):

* $g(x) = x^2$
* $g(x) = \sqrt{x}$
* $g(x) = log(x)$

This transformations can be applied to the independent variable, to the dependent
variable of both.

In the next example we work with $log(\text{Burgers Sold})$ instead of directly 
working with "Burgers Sold".

```{r burgers-residuals-tr2, echo=FALSE}
dat <- read.csv("Burger Data.csv")

outReg <- lm(log(Burgers) ~ Price, data = dat)

# Original Data
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(x    = dat$Price,
     y    = log(dat$Burgers),
     xlab = "Price ($)",
     ylab = "log(Burgers Sold)",
     main = "Transformed Data")
abline(a   = outReg$coefficients[1],
       b   = outReg$coefficients[2],
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)
# Residuals
plot(x = dat$Price,
     y = outReg$residuals,
     xlab = "Price ($)",
     ylab = "Residuals",
     main = "Residuals")
abline(h   = 0,
       lwd = 2)
```

In this case there seems to be a much better fit. We can compare this to the
following transformation $\log{(\text{Price})}$:

```{r burgers-residuals-tr1, echo=FALSE}
dat <- read.csv("Burger Data.csv")

outReg <- lm(Burgers ~ log(Price), data = dat)

# Original Data
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(x    = log(dat$Price),
     y    = dat$Burgers,
     xlab = "log(Price) (log($))",
     ylab = "Burgers Sold",
     main = "Transformed Data")
abline(a   = outReg$coefficients[1],
       b   = outReg$coefficients[2],
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)
# Residuals
plot(x = dat$Price,
     y = outReg$residuals,
     xlab = "log(Price) (log($))",
     ylab = "Residuals",
     main = "Residuals")
abline(h   = 0,
       lwd = 2)
```

It is this these transformations improve the fit of the model, however which one
is the best one?

One can check the $R^2$ of the different transformations:

```{r burgers-residuals-R2}
dat <- read.csv("Burger Data.csv")

x <- dat$Price
y <- dat$Burgers

outRegOri <- lm(y ~ x)
outRegTr1 <- lm(log(y) ~ x)
outRegTr2 <- lm(y ~ log(x))

summary(outRegOri)
summary(outRegTr1)
summary(outRegTr2)
```
We will see other ways to choose the transformation later.

### Heteroscedasticity

Sometimes, errors are expected to increase depending on the explanatory variable.
For example, it could be expected that errors for bigger values of the explanatory
variable will be also bigger.

As an example, consider a new data set with the Height of several children. One
could expect there is a linear relationship between the age of a child and the
height. However, one also would expect that height difference are bigger for 
older children than for younger children. We can see this in the following 
simulated data:

```{r height-data-residuals}
dat <- read.csv("Height Data.csv")

outReg <- lm(Height ~ Age, data = dat)

# Original Data
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(x    = dat$Age,
     y    = dat$Height,
     xlab = "Age (years)",
     ylab = "Height (in)",
     main = "Original Data")
abline(a   = outReg$coefficients[1],
       b   = outReg$coefficients[2],
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)
# Residuals
plot(x = dat$Age,
     y = outReg$residuals,
     xlab = "Age (years)",
     ylab = "Residuals (in)",
     main = "Residuals")
abline(h   = 0,
       lwd = 2)
```

While one can infer this error behavior in the original scatter plot, the residual
plot makes this pattern much more clearly. In the residual plot, it is pretty clear
that the errors increase with the age of the children. While this is not a problem 
in itself when doing least squares estimation, it might be better to consider 
other alternatives that do not penalize the same way the errors at young age than
the errors at a later age. We will see this with weighted least squares.

### Outliers

Sometimes the data follows a linear regression for most of the observations, but
there might be some observations that do not follow the linear relationship.

In the next example, we work with the Wine data set and add outliers, to see the
effect this might have on the estimation.

```{r wine-outliers}
dat <- read.csv("Wine Data.csv")

x <- dat$Glasses
y <- dat$Years

ymin <- min(y, max(y) - 22)
ymax <- max(y, min(y) + 22)
xmin <- min(x)
xmax <- max(x)

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
# No Outliers
outRegNoo <- lm(y ~ x)
plot(x    = x,
     y    = y,
     ylim = c(ymin, ymax),
     xlim = c(xmin, xmax),
     xlab = "Average Glasses per Week",
     ylab = "Life Expectancy",
     main = "No Outliers")
abline(a   = outRegNoo$coefficients[1],
       b   = outRegNoo$coefficients[2],
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)

# Outlier on the left side
# Adds Observation
x <- c(x, 0)
y <- c(y, 90)
outRegLef <- lm(y ~ x)
plot(x    = x,
     y    = y,
     ylim = c(ymin, ymax),
     xlim = c(xmin, xmax),
     xlab = "Average Glasses per Week",
     ylab = "Life Expectancy",
     main = "Outlier Left")
points(x   = x[21],
       y   = y[21],
       pch = 16,
       col = 'blue')
abline(a   = outRegLef$coefficients[1],
       b   = outRegLef$coefficients[2],
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)
# Outlier on the right side
# Adds Observation
x[21] <- 4
y[21] <- 68
outRegRig <- lm(y ~ x)
plot(x    = x,
     y    = y,
     ylim = c(ymin, ymax),
     xlim = c(xmin, xmax),
     xlab = "Average Glasses per Week",
     ylab = "Life Expectancy",
     main = "Right Outliers")
points(x   = x[21],
       y   = y[21],
       pch = 16,
       col = 'blue')
abline(a   = outRegRig$coefficients[1],
       b   = outRegRig$coefficients[2],
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)
# Outlier on the right side
# Adds Observation
x[21] <- 2
y[21] <- 95
outRegCen <- lm(y ~ x)
plot(x    = x,
     y    = y,
     ylim = c(ymin, ymax),
     xlim = c(xmin, xmax),
     xlab = "Average Glasses per Week",
     ylab = "Life Expectancy",
     main = "Center Outliers")
points(x   = x[21],
       y   = y[21],
       pch = 16,
       col = 'blue')
abline(a   = outRegCen$coefficients[1],
       b   = outRegCen$coefficients[2],
       col = 'red',
       lwd = 2)
```
The presence of outliers, will also be more clear when looking at the residuals.

```{r wine-res}
x <- dat$Glasses
y <- dat$Years

ymin <- min(outRegNoo$residuals, outRegLef$residuals, outRegRig$residuals, outRegCen$residuals)
ymax <- max(outRegNoo$residuals, outRegLef$residuals, outRegRig$residuals, outRegCen$residuals)
xmin <- min(x)
xmax <- max(x)

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(x    = dat$Glasses,
     y    = outRegNoo$residuals,
     ylim = c(ymin, ymax),
     xlim = c(xmin, xmax),
     xlab = "Average Glasses per Week",
     ylab = "Residuals",
     main = "No Outliers")
abline(h   = 0,
       lwd = 2)

# Outlier on the left side
x[21] <- 0
y[21] <- 90
plot(x    = x,
     y    = outRegLef$residuals,
     ylim = c(ymin, ymax),
     xlim = c(xmin, xmax),
     xlab = "Average Glasses per Week",
     ylab = "Residuals",
     main = "Left Outlier")
abline(h   = 0,
       lwd = 2)
# Outlier on the right side
# Adds Observation
x[21] <- 4
y[21] <- 68
plot(x    = x,
     y    = outRegRig$residuals,
     ylim = c(ymin, ymax),
     xlim = c(xmin, xmax),
     xlab = "Average Glasses per Week",
     ylab = "Residuals",
     main = "Left Outlier")
abline(h   = 0,
       lwd = 2)
# Outlier on the right side
# Adds Observation
x[21] <- 2
y[21] <- 95
plot(x    = x,
     y    = outRegCen$residuals,
     ylim = c(ymin, ymax),
     xlim = c(xmin, xmax),
     xlab = "Average Glasses per Week",
     ylab = "Residuals",
     main = "Left Outlier")
abline(h   = 0,
       lwd = 2)
```
And we can also see how the $R^2$ changes:

```{r wine-r2_change}
summary(outRegNoo)
summary(outRegLef)
summary(outRegRig)
summary(outRegCen)
```

### Variables Ommited

When looking at the residuals, there should be no aparent pattern. Sometimes, 
the pattern is only noticeable when considering other variables. We can see this
with the Height data set. The data includes the sex of the children. If you fit
least squares without taking this into consideration, a pattern is appears in the
residuals when you look at the residuals for each sex.

```{r height-other-var}
dat <- read.csv("Height Data.csv")

# Fits linear Model
outReg <- lm(dat$Height ~ dat$Age)

# Plots residuals for each sex
ymin <- min(outReg$residuals)

## Cross-Validation

When testing different models, a good idea to evaluate the performance of each
model beyond $R^2$, is to separate your data set into a training set and a 
validation or test set. Doing this is called cross-validation. There are several
alternatives to doing cross-validation, here are a few of the most relevant ones:

1. **Holdout Method (Train/Test Split)**
   - **Description**: The data is split into two (or three) sets: training and test (and sometimes validation). The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set.
   - **Use Case**: 
     - Simple to implement, but has high variance. The performance may depend on the specific split.

2. **K-Fold Cross-Validation**
   - **Description**: The data is divided into \( k \) equal-sized folds (subsets). The model is trained on \( k-1 \) folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated \( k \) times, with each fold used as the test set once.
   - **Use Case**: 
     - Works well for most applications and balances the bias-variance tradeoff.
     - Common choices for \( k \): 5, 10.

3. **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**
   - **Description**: Each data point is used once as a test set, and the rest of the data is used as the training set. This results in \( n \) iterations, where \( n \) is the number of samples.
   - **Use Case**:
     - Good when the dataset is small, but can be computationally expensive for large datasets.

4. **Leave-P-Out Cross-Validation (LPOCV)**
   - **Description**: Similar to LOOCV, but instead of leaving out one data point, \( p \) data points are left out. This creates \( \binom{n}{p} \) different training/testing splits.
   - **Use Case**:
     - Rarely used due to its high computational cost for large datasets but might be useful in specific scenarios.

5. **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation**
   - **Description**: Similar to K-fold cross-validation but ensures that each fold has the same proportion of each class in classification tasks (i.e., balanced classes in each fold).
   - **Use Case**: 
     - Useful for imbalanced datasets in classification problems.
     
6. **Repeated K-Fold Cross-Validation**
   - **Description**: A variation of K-Fold Cross-Validation where the process is repeated multiple times with different random splits.
   - **Use Case**:
     - Provides more robust estimates of model performance, particularly when the dataset is small.
     
Here is an example of \(k\)-fold Cross-Validation using the "Burger Data" set.

```{r cross-validation}
### Cross Validation Example

# Read Data
dat <- read.csv(file = "Burger Data.csv")

# Saves Variables
x <- dat$Price
y <- dat$Burgers

# Number of Observations
n <- length(y)

# Number of Folds
numFol <- 10
# Fold Size
sizFol <- round(n / numFol)

# List Containing the Fold indices
fol <- list()
# Select Fold Indeces
# Initialization
ind <- 1:n
for(i in 1:numFol){
  # Computes the remaining number of indices
  numInd   <- length(ind)
  # Randomly selects indices from the remaining indeces
  indFol   <- sample(x = 1:length(ind), size = sizFol, replace = FALSE)
  # Saves the inidices to the list of Fold Indeces
  fol[[i]] <- ind[indFol]
  # Removes the indices from the indeces vector
  ind      <- ind[- indFol]
}

# Models to try
X <- cbind(x, log(x),      x, log(x))
Y <- cbind(y,      y, log(y), log(y))

# Number of Models to compare
numMod <- dim(Y)[2]
# Saves the validation metric for each model and each fold 
matMet <- matrix(data = NA, nrow = numFol, ncol = numMod)


par(mfrow=c(2, 2))
# Loops through the models
for(k in 1:numMod){
  yMod <- Y[, k]
  xMod <- X[, k]
  plot(x = xMod,
       y = yMod,
       xlab = "Price ($)",
       ylab = "Burgers",
       main = paste0("Model ", k))
  metFol <- numeric(length = numFol)
  # Loops through the folds
  for(i in 1:numFol){
    # At Each Fold do Linear Regression without the test set
    outReg   <- lm(yMod[-fol[[i]]] ~ xMod[-fol[[i]]])
    # Evaluate Out of Sample
    yHatOut   <- outReg$coefficients[1] + outReg$coefficients[2] * xMod[fol[[i]]] 
    if(k >= 3 ){
      metEva    <- mean((exp(yMod[fol[[i]]]) - exp(yHatOut))^2)
    } else {
      metEva    <- mean((yMod[fol[[i]]] - yHatOut)^2)
    }
    metFol[i] <- metEva
  }
  matMet[, k] <- metFol
}
```

## Weighted Least Squares

Weighted Least Squares (WLS) is an extension of ordinary least squares (OLS) used when the assumption of constant variance (homoscedasticity) is violated. In cases of heteroscedasticity (unequal variances), OLS produces inefficient estimates. 

WLS solves this by assigning weights to each observation, giving more importance to data points with lower variance. This leads to more reliable estimates in the presence of heteroscedasticity, making WLS valuable for improving regression models when error variances vary.

- **Lower variance** â†’ **Higher weight**
- **Higher variance** â†’ **Lower weight**

In a simple linear regression model with one independent variable, OLS minimizes the sum of squared residuals:

$$ \min \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 = \min \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)^2
$$

Weighted Least Squares (WLS) corrects for heteroscedasticity by minimizing the weighted sum of squared residuals:
$$
\min \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 = \min \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)^2
$$

Step 1: Define the weighted residual sum of squares

The objective function is:

$$Q_w(\beta_0, \beta_1) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)^2$$

We aim to minimize $Q(\beta_0, \beta_1)$ with respect to $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$.

Step 2: Take the partial derivatives with respect to $ \beta_0 $ and $ \beta_1 $:

$$\frac{\partial Q_w}{\partial \beta_0} = -2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)$$

Setting the derivative equal to zero:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i) = 0 $$
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i y_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i)$$
$$\beta_0 \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i + \beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i y_i \tag{3}$$

Now with respect to \( \beta_1 \):

$$\frac{\partial Q_w}{\partial \beta_1} = -2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i) x_i$$

Setting the derivative equal to zero:

$$-2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i) x_i = 0$$
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i y_i x_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i) x_i$$

$$\beta_0 \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i + \beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i y_i x_i \tag{4}$$

Now we solve the system of two linear equations:

1. \( \beta_0 \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i + \beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i y_i \)
2. \( \beta_0 \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i + \beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i y_i x_i \)

Solve for \( \beta_1 \)

Multiply equation (3) by $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}$ and subtract it from equation (4) to eliminate $\beta_0$:

$$\beta_1 \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i^2 - \frac{\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i \right)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i} \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i y_i x_i - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}$$

Thus, $\beta_1$ is:

$$\beta_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i y_i - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i^2 - \frac{\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i \right)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}}$$

Then the weighted estimators for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are:

$$\hgb_{w,1} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i y_i - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i^2 - \frac{\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i \right)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}},$$

$$\hgb_{w,0} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i y_i - \beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}.$$

## Model in Matrix Form

We can specify the same model as in [Model](#model), in matrix form as follows:

$$\by = \bX \bgb + \be$$
where:

* $\by={y_1,\ldots,y_n}'$
* $\be={e_1,\ldots,e_n}'$
* $\bgb={\beta_0,\beta_1}'$
* $\bX=[\mathbb{1}_n \bx]$
* $\mathbb{1}_n={1,\ldots,1}'$ (1 $n$-times).

In this way we can re-write our minimization problem as follows:

$$ \min \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 = \min \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)^2
= \min \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\by - \bX \bgb)'(\by - \bX \bgb)$$
equivalent to:
$$\min \by'\by - \by'\bX\bgb - \bgb'\bX'\by + \bgb'\bX'\bX\bgb$$

The procedure to find the estimators is very similar, working with the gradient
instead of the partial derivatives:

$$\nabla_\beta Q = \mathbf{0} $$
then:
$$-\bX'\by -\bX'\by + 2 \bX' \bX \bgb = \bzero$$
$$2 \bX' \bX \bgb = 2 \bX'\by$$
$$\bX' \bX \bgb = \bX'\by$$
$$\bgb = \left(\bX' \bX \right)^{-1}\bX'\by$$

Notice how we find the estimates much easier. It is also easy to show that a
minimum is attained by computing the **Hessian Matrix** of $Q$

$$H_Q = 2 \bX' \bX$$

and noticing that:

$$\bX' \bX$$

is [positive-definite](#positive-definite-matrix) if $\bx$ is not a constant vector.

We can verify that indeed the estimate $\hat{\bgb}$ is the same as before by
manually doing the computations for this case:

We have:

   $$
   \mathbf{X} = \begin{bmatrix}
   1 & x_1 \\
   1 & x_2 \\
   \vdots & \vdots \\
   1 & x_n
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$

   $$
   \mathbf{X}' = \begin{bmatrix}
   1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
   x_1 & x_2 & \cdots & x_n
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$

   Multiplying $\mathbf{X}'$ by $\mathbf{X}$:

   $$
   \mathbf{X}' \mathbf{X} = \begin{bmatrix}
   n & \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\
   \sum_{i=1}^n x_i & \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$
Similarly, we have:

   $$
   \mathbf{y} = \begin{bmatrix}
   y_1 \\
   y_2 \\
   \vdots \\
   y_n
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$

   Multiplying $\mathbf{X}'$ by $\mathbf{y}$:

   $$
   \mathbf{X}' \mathbf{y} = \begin{bmatrix}
   \sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\
   \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$

To compute the inverse of $\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X}$ we have that the determinant is:

   $$
   |\mathbf{X}' \mathbf{X}|=\text{det}(\mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{X}) = n \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - \left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right)^2
   $$

   Then, the inverse is:

   $$
   (\mathbf{X}' \mathbf{X})^{-1} = \frac{1}{n \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - \left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right)^2}
   \begin{bmatrix}
   \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 & - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\
   - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i & n
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$

Then, we have that:

\begin{align*}
   (\mathbf{X}' \mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{y} 
      &= \frac{1}{n \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - \left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right)^2}
   \begin{bmatrix}
   \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 & - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\
   - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i & n
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
   \sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\
   \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i
   \end{bmatrix} \\
      &= \begin{bmatrix}
   \frac{1}{n \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - \left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right)^2} \left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \sum_{i=1}^n y_i - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i \right) \\
   \frac{1}{n \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - \left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right)^2} \left( - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \sum_{i=1}^n y_i + n \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i \right)
   \end{bmatrix} \\
      &= \begin{bmatrix}
   \frac{1}{n \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - (n \bar{x})^2} \left( n \bar{y} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - n \bar{x} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i \right) \\
   \frac{1}{n \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - (n \bar{x})^2} \left( - n \bar{x}n \bar{y} + n \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i \right)
   \end{bmatrix} \\ 

\end{align*}

Now simplifying, the first row, we have that:

\begin{align*}
\frac{n \bar{y} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - n \bar{x} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i}{n \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - (n \bar{x})^2}
  &= \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - n\bar{x}^2} \left( \bar{y} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - \bar{x} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i \right) \\
  &= \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - n\bar{x}^2} \left( \bar{y} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - \bar{y} n\bar{x}^2 + \bar{y} n\bar{x}^2   - \bar{x} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i \right) \\
  &= \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - n\bar{x}^2} \left( \bar{y} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - \bar{y} n\bar{x}^2 + \bar{y} n\bar{x}^2   - \bar{x} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i \right) \\
  &= \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - n\bar{x}^2} \left( \bar{y} \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - n\bar{x}^2 \right) + \bar{x} \left(n\bar{y}\bar{x}   - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i \right) \right) \\
  &= \bar{y} + \bar{x} \frac{n\bar{y}\bar{x} - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - n\bar{x}^2} \\
  &= \bar{y} + \bar{x} \frac{-(n-1)S_{xy}}{(n-1)S_{xx}} \\
  &= \bar{y} - \beta_1 \bar{x}
\end{align*}

And simplifying the second row, we have:

$$\frac{1}{n \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - (n \bar{x})^2} \left( - n \bar{x}n \bar{y} + n \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i \right) = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - n \bar{x}^2} \left( - n\bar{x}\bar{y} + \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i \right) = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \beta_1$$

So both expressions are equivalent.

### Weighted Least Squares in Matrix Form

In a similar way we can solve the weighted least squares problem in matrix form
as follows:

$$Q_w = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)^2 = (\by - \bX \bgb)'\bW (\by - \bX \bgb) = \by'\bW\by -\by'\bW\bX\bgb - \bgb'\bX'\bW\by + \bgb'\bX'\bW\bX \bgb $$

where, $\bW$ is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries $w_1,\ldots,w_n$.

then the gradient is:

$$ \nabla_\beta Q_w = -2 \bX'\bW\by + 2\bX'\bW\bX \bgb $$

then, making it equal to zero, we have that:

$$ 2\bX'\bW\bX \bgb = 2 \bX'\bW\by$$
$$\bX'\bW\bX \bgb = \bX'\bW\by $$
$$\bgb = \left(\bX'\bW\bX\right)^{-1}\bX'\bW\by $$

And the Hessian Matrix is given by:

$$H_{Q_w} = 2 \bX'\bW\bX$$

which is positive-definite under the same conditions that before and if the entries
of $\bW$ are positive.
