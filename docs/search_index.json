These are categorized into five key topics: General Math Linear Algebra Probability Statistics Calculus 2.1 General Math You should be familiar with the summation operator \\(\\sum\\). This operator is defined as follows: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_n \\] Key properties of the summation operator include: Linearity: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^N (a + b x_i) = aN + b \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\\] Additivity: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i + y_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i + \\sum_{i=1}^N y_i\\] 2.2 Linear Algebra You should be familiar with the following linear algebra concepts: Matrices Determinants Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors Diagonalization Vector Spaces Linear Transformations 2.3 Probability Key probability concepts to understand include: Expected Value Variance Covariance Correlation Joint, Marginal, and Conditional Distributions Independence Central Limit Theorem Distributions: Normal Chi-Squared (\\(\\chi^2\\)) t-distribution F-distribution 2.4 Statistics Essential statistical concepts include: Point Estimation: Maximum Likelihood Least Squares Estimation Properties of Point Estimators: Unbiased Consistent Minimum Variance Interval Estimation Hypothesis Testing 2.5 Calculus Key calculus topics include: Gradients Optimization "],["introduction.html", "3 Introduction 3.1 Examples", " 3 Introduction Linear regression can be used when you have at least two variables varaibles, one dependent and at least one independent. Linear regression is linked to the correlation coeficcient of the variables, we will see where the link is at. While you can do linear regression for a varaiety of raesons, there are usually 3 main resons: Description: You want to describe the relationship between the variables that you are analizing. Control: You want to know how the dependent variable is going to change based on changes you do on the independent variables. Predicition: You want to know how the independent variable will be when you have a new observation of the independent variables. 3.1 Examples 3.1.1 Ad Spending Suppose you are a new data scientiest of a matress company. Your manager wants you to analyze the relationship between the ad spending on Google search results and the revenue for matress sales. I have simulated a data set corresponding to this situation: # Ad Spending Example # Set Seed set.seed(8272024) # Data Simulation x &lt;- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 70, sd = 30) y &lt;- 1000 + 5 * x + rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 100) # Creates the Data Frame datAd &lt;- data.frame(cbind(y,x)) # Names the Variables colnames(datAd) &lt;- c(&quot;Revenue&quot;, &quot;Ad Spending&quot;) # Saves to csv write.csv(x = datAd[, c(1, 2)], file = &quot;Ad spending Data.csv&quot;, row.names = FALSE) If you are only provided the data set, you can read it as follows: dat &lt;- read.csv(file = &quot;Ad spending Data.csv&quot;) You can plot the data as follows: plot(x = dat$Ad.Spending, y = dat$Revenue, xlab = &quot;Ad Spending ($)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Revenue ($)&quot;) And you can perform linear regression analysis as follows: outReg &lt;- lm(Revenue ~ Ad.Spending, data = dat) You can check out the most important results of the regression analysis as follows: summary(outReg) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Revenue ~ Ad.Spending, data = dat) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -248.394 -58.805 3.782 63.577 196.745 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) ## (Intercept) 997.3894 28.8185 34.61 &lt;2e-16 *** ## Ad.Spending 5.0247 0.3818 13.16 &lt;2e-16 *** ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## ## Residual standard error: 89.01 on 98 degrees of freedom ## Multiple R-squared: 0.6386, Adjusted R-squared: 0.6349 ## F-statistic: 173.2 on 1 and 98 DF, p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16 For now, we will focus on the Estimate of the intercept and Ad.Spending coefficient. The intercept is telling you what happens when there is 0 ad spending. In this case through your analysis you see that when there is no ad campaing you still see sales of matresses for $997.3893514. And according to the value of the coefficient for Ad.Spending, for each dollar spent on ads you increase your revenue by $5.0247439. We can plot the regression line on top of the plot as follows: plot(x = dat$Ad.Spending, y = dat$Revenue, xlab = &quot;Ad Spending ($)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Revenue ($)&quot;) abline(a = outReg$coefficients[1], b = outReg$coefficients[2], col = &#39;red&#39;, lwd = 2) The regression line here is the “best line” for this variables. The “best line” in this case means it is the line that minimizes the sum of the squared distances of each point to the line. Here are some other examples of other lines that we can see visually that are not the best lines: Different slope (that is the coefficient for the Ad.spending variable) plot(x = dat$Ad.Spending, y = dat$Revenue, xlab = &quot;Ad Spending ($)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Revenue ($)&quot;) abline(a = outReg$coefficients[1], b = outReg$coefficients[2], col = &#39;red&#39;, lwd = 2) abline(a = outReg$coefficients[1], b = 6, col = &#39;blue&#39;, lwd = 2) And different inttercept: plot(x = dat$Ad.Spending, y = dat$Revenue, xlab = &quot;Ad Spending ($)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Revenue ($)&quot;) abline(a = outReg$coefficients[1], b = outReg$coefficients[2], col = &#39;red&#39;, lwd = 2) abline(a = 1100, b = outReg$coefficients[2], col = &#39;blue&#39;, lwd = 2) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
