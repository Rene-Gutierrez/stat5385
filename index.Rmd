## Course Overview

This course is designed for graduate students in Statistics and related fields, presenting **Linear Regression** as both a mathematical and a statistical modeling framework. The material develops the topic systematically, moving from rigorous mathematical foundations to a probabilistic understanding of regression. No results are assumed without being first derived or stated in the text, making the course **entirely self-contained**.

Throughout all chapters, **examples and code are used extensively**—primarily in **R**—to illustrate theoretical results, verify algebraic derivations, and visualize statistical concepts.
This integration of **mathematical theory and computational practice** ensures that students not only understand each result formally but also see how it operates in applied settings.

The course is organized into several chapters, each serving a specific pedagogical purpose and building upon the previous one.

### Chapter 2 — Mathematical Prerequisites

Chapter 2 provides a **comprehensive review of the mathematical tools** required for the course, including essential topics from **Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, and Statistics**.

The goal is not to provide a general background, but to present precisely those results that are **used explicitly** in later chapters. Every theorem, identity, or property invoked afterward is included here, ensuring that the course can be followed without external references.

Code examples in this chapter are used mainly to **illustrate matrix operations and probabilistic concepts** numerically, bridging abstract results with computational intuition.

---

### Chapter 3 — The Linear Regression Problem

Chapter 3 introduces the **core modeling framework** of the course: Linear Regression.
The emphasis is on **understanding the purpose and intuition** behind regression analysis—modeling the relationship between dependent and independent variables and interpreting regression coefficients.

Concepts are introduced through **simple applied examples**, often accompanied by R code that demonstrates how theoretical constructs translate into real data analysis.
By the end of the chapter, students understand both the **conceptual motivation** and the **computational implementation** of regression.

---

### Chapters 4 to 6 — Linear Regression as an Optimization Problem

Chapters 4 through 6 approach linear regression from a **Machine Learning perspective**, treating it as a **pure optimization problem** before introducing any probabilistic assumptions.

This approach has two main objectives:

1. To **derive the mechanics of least squares estimation** using linear algebra and geometry.
2. To **develop familiarity with the algebraic structures** that will later reappear in the probabilistic framework.

Each chapter is heavily supported by **worked examples and code demonstrations**, which replicate derivations computationally and visualize concepts such as projections, residuals, and model fit.
This combination of symbolic and computational work helps students develop both mathematical insight and applied proficiency.

* **Chapter 4** introduces **Simple Linear Regression** (one independent variable), deriving the least squares estimator analytically and interpreting it geometrically as an orthogonal projection.
* **Chapter 5** serves as a **bridge** between simple and multiple regression by exploring models where transformations of a single variable can be treated as multiple predictors.
* **Chapter 6** generalizes to **Multiple Linear Regression**, fully expressed in matrix form. This chapter develops central results such as the normal equations, projection matrices, and the decomposition of sums of squares, with accompanying R code to verify and illustrate each result.

Together, these chapters form the **mathematical backbone** of regression analysis and provide a hands-on understanding of how theory translates into computation.

### Chapter 7 — Introducing Uncertainty

Chapter 7 marks the **transition from deterministic optimization to stochastic modeling**.
Here, uncertainty is formally introduced—both in the estimated coefficients and in derived quantities such as fitted values and residuals.

This chapter can be viewed from two complementary perspectives:

* As a **machine learning perspective**, focusing on variability due to sample dependence;
* Or as a **statistical perspective**, where such variability is interpreted as randomness governed by a probabilistic model.

Coding examples in this chapter illustrate **empirical estimation of variability** (e.g., via resampling or bootstrapping), providing a concrete understanding of uncertainty before formal statistical assumptions are introduced.

---

### Chapters 8 and 9 — Probabilistic Modeling and Statistical Inference

The final section of the course introduces **probabilistic models** for regression, enabling formal **statistical inference**.

* **Chapter 8** studies the properties of the least squares estimator under **minimal assumptions**—specifically, assuming only the **mean and variance** of the errors.
  Here, key results such as the **unbiasedness** of the estimator and the **Gauss–Markov theorem** are derived and supported by simulations verifying theoretical properties empirically.

* **Chapter 9** introduces the **normality assumption**, which allows the full machinery of **statistical inference**.
  Students derive and visualize **sampling distributions**, **confidence intervals**, **hypothesis tests**, and **prediction intervals**. Each concept is accompanied by **code examples** that connect algebraic derivations with their computational implementation.

These chapters transition the course from purely mathematical reasoning to **fully probabilistic thinking**, equipping students to use regression as a formal inferential tool.

### Summary

The course follows a **progressive and integrated structure**:

1. **Mathematical foundations** — Chapter 2
2. **Conceptual introduction to regression** — Chapter 3
3. **Optimization and linear algebraic formulation** — Chapters 4–6
4. **Introduction of uncertainty** — Chapter 7
5. **Statistical inference and probabilistic modeling** — Chapters 8–9

Throughout the course, **R code and applied examples** are used to reinforce every theoretical result.
This dual emphasis on **mathematical rigor** and **computational practice** ensures that students gain a deep understanding of both how linear regression works in theory and how it is implemented and interpreted in real data analysis.

By the end, students will be able to derive regression results from first principles, verify them computationally, and apply them confidently in research and applied contexts.
